## Vision

Local grave care registry (NYC/NJ, Russian-speaking) → global grave care marketplace.

**Model**: Two-sided marketplace connecting families with grave care professionals (cleaning, flowers, photo updates, maintenance).

**Diaspora wedge**: Tending.app sells convenience ("we'll do it for you"). Raduna sells something deeper: "You cannot visit. We make it possible." Diaspora customers have higher willingness to pay, stronger cultural triggers, and no alternative.

## Expansion Sequence

1. **Russian NYC/NJ** — prove supply side works (now - Q3 2026)
2. **Russian diaspora US-wide** — Chicago, LA, Philly, South Florida (Q3 2026 - Q1 2027)
3. **Eastern European diaspora** — Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian (2027)
4. **Other diaspora** — Jewish (yahrzeit), Chinese (Qingming), Latino (Dia de los Muertos) (2027-2028)
5. **Mainstream global** (2028+)

Each community requires a cultural partner/advisor. Cannot just translate the app.

## Competitive Moat

- **Trust moat**: No one switches providers for their mother's grave
- **Supply density moat**: First to own a metro wins (3-5 reliable providers per area)
- **Data moat**: Cemetery records, grave locations, provider ratings, seasonal patterns
- **Cultural community effects**: Word of mouth in diaspora communities is extremely powerful

Weak classical network effects, but strong retention and supply-side lock-in.

---

## What Must Be True

1. **Supply-side quality is solvable at scale** — reliable people who treat graves with respect
2. **Willingness to pay is real** — prove by May 1 with 50 paying customers
3. **Cultural expansion transfers** — same emotional driver (distance + obligation + guilt) activates across communities
4. **Cemetery partnerships are achievable** — data, access, co-marketing
5. **Full-time operational attention by Phase 2** — AI builds the app, humans manage providers and customers

## Decision Gates

| Milestone | Timeline | If YES | If NO |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50 paying families | May 2026 | Continue Phase 1 | Rethink thesis |
| 200+ paying families | Sep 2026 | Plan Phase 2 expansion | Stay local, optimize |
| 500+ monthly transactions | Dec 2026 | Raise $500K-$1.5M seed | Keep as lifestyle business |
| Multi-community traction | Mid 2027 | Scale operations | License or sell |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Launch March 14 (iOS)
2. Recruit 5-10 providers manually before Radonitsa (April 21)
3. Prove willingness to pay: 50 families by May 1
4. Track: transactions, revenue, provider quality, NPS
5. Do not think about Phase 2+ until Phase 1 signal is clear

## Key Insight

> "The app is the easy part. The hard part is having a trusted person show up at a cemetery in Queens on April 21 with the right flowers, take a respectful photo, and send it to a woman in Berlin who has not visited her mother's grave in 7 years."

Option 4 is underrated: $1M ARR grave care business with 90% margins and minimal overhead is a fantastic asset even if it never becomes a billion-dollar company.
